# Form Designer

The project aims to create a user-friendly system for designing forms and binding them with events, as well as fetching data from SQL or APIs. The main focus of this project is to provide a simple and efficient way for users to create forms, bind them with events, and retrieve data from different sources. The forms can be designed using a drag-and-drop interface, making it easy for users to create complex forms without needing extensive programming knowledge. The data can be fetched from SQL or APIs and displayed in the forms, enabling users to view and manipulate data in real-time. The project seeks to improve the workflow and productivity of users by providing a streamlined solution for form design and data retrieval.
